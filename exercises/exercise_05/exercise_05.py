# Exercise 5: Tuples and Named Tuples
# Objective: Work with tuples and named tuples for structured data

# Hints:
# - Create tuple: point = (x, y)
# - Unpack tuple: x, y = point
# - Import namedtuple: from collections import namedtuple
# - Define namedtuple: Student = namedtuple('Student', ['field1', 'field2'])
# - Access fields: student.name or student[0]
# - Tuples are immutable!
