# Python Intermediate Practice Exercises

This collection provides **25 structured exercises** designed to take you from basic Python knowledge to advanced proficiency. These exercises cover intermediate-level topics and build systematically on foundational concepts.

## Structure

Each exercise includes three files:
- **Problem file** (`exercise_XX_problem.md`) - describes objectives, requirements, and hints
- **Solution file** (`exercise_XX_solution.md`) - explains the approach with key concepts
- **Starter code** (`exercise_XX.py`) - provides a template with guidance

## Learning Progression

The exercises build systematically through five levels:

1. **Intermediate Foundations (1-5)**: Object-oriented basics, sets, lambda functions, exception handling, tuples
2. **Advanced Data & Functions (6-10)**: Inheritance, decorators, regular expressions, JSON, generators
3. **Advanced OOP & Patterns (11-15)**: Multiple inheritance, properties, context managers, custom exceptions, magic methods
4. **Real-World Applications (16-20)**: CSV processing, datetime handling, iterators, collections module, SQLite databases
5. **Capstone Projects (21-25)**: Complex projects integrating multiple concepts

## Key Topics Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, magic methods
- **Functional Programming**: Lambda, map, filter, reduce, decorators
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Sets, named tuples, Counter, defaultdict, deque
- **Data Processing**: JSON, CSV, regular expressions
- **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks, custom exceptions, context managers
- **Generators & Iterators**: Yield, iterator protocol, lazy evaluation
- **Database Operations**: SQLite basics, CRUD operations
- **Date & Time**: Working with datetime module
- **Advanced Patterns**: Property decorators, context managers, multiple inheritance

## Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic Python syntax and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and basic list/dictionary operations
- Simple file I/O
- Basic list comprehensions

## Recommended Approach

1. **Type, don't copy**: Manually typing code helps build muscle memory
2. **Experiment**: Modify the code to see what happens
3. **Read errors carefully**: Error messages are your friends
4. **Try before checking**: Attempt each problem before looking at the solution
5. **Build on previous exercises**: Later exercises assume knowledge from earlier ones

## Common Intermediate Pitfalls to Avoid

- Forgetting `self` in class methods
- Mutating default arguments in functions
- Not understanding the difference between shallow and deep copies
- Incorrect exception handling (catching too broad exceptions)
- Not closing files/database connections (use context managers!)
- Mixing tabs and spaces (always use 4 spaces)
- Not understanding mutable vs immutable types
- Forgetting to call `super()` in inheritance

## Tips for Success

- Practice regularly - consistency beats intensity
- Read the Python documentation for modules you're using
- Experiment in the Python REPL to test concepts
- Don't rush through levels - mastery takes time
- Join Python communities for help and discussion
- Build your own variations of these exercises
