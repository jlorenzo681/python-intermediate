# Python Intermediate Exercises

A comprehensive collection of **25 structured exercises** designed to take you from basic to advanced Python proficiency. These exercises cover intermediate and advanced topics, building systematically on foundational Python knowledge.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains exercises that bridge the gap between beginner and expert Python programming. Each exercise includes:
- **Problem description** with clear objectives and requirements
- **Detailed solution** with comprehensive explanations
- **Starter code** with helpful hints

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

These exercises are perfect for:
- Developers who know Python basics and want to level up
- Programmers transitioning from other languages to Python
- Students preparing for intermediate Python interviews
- Anyone wanting to master Python's advanced features

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic Python syntax (variables, data types, operators)
- Control flow (if/else, for/while loops)
- Functions and basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Simple file I/O operations
- Basic list comprehensions

## 📖 Course Structure

### Level 1: Intermediate Foundations (Exercises 1-5)
- Object-Oriented Programming basics
- Working with sets
- Lambda functions and functional programming
- Exception handling
- Tuples and named tuples

### Level 2: Advanced Data & Functions (Exercises 6-10)
- Class inheritance and method overriding
- Function decorators
- Regular expressions
- JSON data processing
- Generators and yield

### Level 3: Advanced OOP & Patterns (Exercises 11-15)
- Multiple inheritance and MRO
- Property decorators and getters/setters
- Context managers
- Custom exceptions
- Magic methods (dunder methods)

### Level 4: Real-World Applications (Exercises 16-20)
- CSV file processing
- Datetime manipulation
- Iterators and the iterator protocol
- Collections module (Counter, defaultdict, deque)
- SQLite database operations

### Level 5: Capstone Projects (Exercises 21-25)
- Contact Management System (OOP + JSON persistence)
- Log File Analyzer (regex + file processing)
- Task Scheduler (SQLite + datetime)
- Data Pipeline (generators + functional programming)
- Inventory Management System (comprehensive integration)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlorenzo681/python-intermediate.git
   cd python-intermediate
   ```

2. **Navigate to an exercise**
   ```bash
   cd exercises/exercise_01
   ```

3. **Read the problem**
   ```bash
   cat exercise_01_problem.md
   ```

4. **Try solving it yourself**
   - Open `exercise_01.py` in your editor
   - Try to solve the problem without looking at the solution
   - Run your code and test it

5. **Check the solution**
   ```bash
   cat exercise_01_solution.md
   ```

## 💡 How to Use These Exercises

1. **Read First**: Carefully read the problem description and requirements
2. **Plan**: Think about your approach before coding
3. **Code**: Implement your solution in the starter file
4. **Test**: Run your code and verify it works
5. **Compare**: Only then, look at the provided solution
6. **Understand**: Read the explanation to understand *why* the solution works
7. **Experiment**: Modify the code to deepen understanding

## 🎓 Learning Tips

- **Type, Don't Copy**: Manually type the code to build muscle memory
- **Experiment**: Modify examples to see what happens
- **Read Errors**: Error messages are learning opportunities
- **Progress Sequentially**: Later exercises build on earlier concepts
- **Take Notes**: Document what you learn
- **Practice Regularly**: Consistency beats intensity
- **Join Communities**: Discuss solutions with others

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, magic methods
- **Functional Programming**: Lambda, map, filter, reduce, decorators
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Sets, named tuples, Counter, defaultdict, deque
- **Data Processing**: CSV, JSON, regular expressions
- **Error Handling**: Try/except, custom exceptions, context managers
- **Generators & Iterators**: Yield, iterator protocol, lazy evaluation
- **Database Operations**: SQLite CRUD operations
- **Date & Time**: Working with datetime module
- **Design Patterns**: Decorators, context managers, properties

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Standard library only (no external dependencies needed)
